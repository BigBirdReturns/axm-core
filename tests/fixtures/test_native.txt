Hemostatic Agents

Hemostatic agents are substances that stop bleeding by promoting clot formation. Common hemostatic agents include:

1. Tranexamic acid - inhibits fibrinolysis
2. Thrombin - directly converts fibrinogen to fibrin
3. Gelatin sponges - provide matrix for clot formation
4. Combat gauze - kaolin-impregnated gauze for field use

These agents are critical in trauma care and surgical settings.
